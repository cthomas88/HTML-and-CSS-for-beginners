        <h2 class="second_header">How to use this page</h2>
        <p>This page is completely open source, and the code and files are available for ALL to download.
            I, Carlie, created a mini website for anyone to practise on, change, adapt, edit and style 
            in any which way they desire, with the hopes this can be a place for those who are beginning 
            with coding to come and have a go at some real live code.</br> 
            This page and its files can be found on GitHub, an AMAZING resource for programmers and coders
            to come together and collaborate on projects together, receive tips and advice and swap code. 
            If you would like to view the original repository for this page then click 
            <a href="https://github.com/cthomas88" target="_blank">HERE</a>

    <div class="section_2">
        <h2 class="third_header">Rules</h2>
        <p>When playing with this code and styling it, try to keep with the current theme, however I do
            understand that this will change over time. Use fonts that have been used elsewhere on the page
            and use inkeeping colors and themes. When it comes to using HTML elements and tags, use those
            which are new to you, or you are trying to practise with, and the same goes with CSS.</br> This
            may seem overly simple and pointless, but to those starting out can be valuable. You can view 
            previous changes and see how people did what they did by viewing older commits. Have fun and be daring
            with your code! Learn something new every day!

        <h2 class="section_3">What will you learn today?</h2>
        <p class="star_wars">Why don't you try turning this </br>
            text box into a star wars type text</br>
            scroll, where it fades in the </br>
            distance, using purely css? Don't think its possible? </br>
            I have done it before and its easier than you think!</br>
            Obviously if you feel the need to, create more text </br>
            here to elongate the paragraph. This will affect the time</br>
            it takes for the text to travel up the page and into the </br>
            fade our area.
